===========

Part: each separately specified component of the project we're processing.

Step: each of the tasks we need to fulfill in order to obtain the
  final artifacts resulting from processing the project specification.
  Steps are, in this order: PULL, BUILD, STAGE, and PRIME.

State: a collection of metadata gathered from the context used in the
  execution of each step for a given part. A state must exist for every
  step executed for a part.

Part dependency: parts may depend on other parts, meaning that the part
  we're depending on must complete its STAGE step before we execute our
  BUILD step.

Part order: the sorting order of parts places dependent parts after the
  parts they depend on. If no dependency relation exists, parts are
  sorted alphabetically by name. Dependency cycles are not allowed.
